Data from experiment 2, in which subjects judged the direction of a tactile frequency sweep (centered at 230 Hz) in the presence of an auditory frequency sweep distractor.
Auditory distractors were white noise or upward frequency sweeps with depths of 100 Hz, 200 Hz, or 300 Hz. All sweeps were centered on 230 Hz.

Data format:

-column 1: block number

-column 2: trial number within block

-column 3: auditory distractor variable.  0 indicates white noise, 1 indicates an upward sweep of 100 Hz, 2 indicates an upward sweep of 200 Hz, 3 indicates an upward sweep of 300 Hz

-column 4: tactile sweep depth. Negative numbers indicate downward sweeps

-column 5: subject's response. 1 indicates that they perceived an upward tactile sweep, 2 indicates that they perceived a downward tactile sweep

-column 6: subject's response time (in seconds)
