Data from experiment 1, in which subjects judged the direction of a tactile frequency sweep (centered at 230 Hz) in the presence of an auditory frequency sweep distractor.
Auditory distractors were white noise or a 150 Hz sweep going either upwards or downwards, and centered on 230 Hz.

Data format:

-column 1: block number

-column 2: trial number within block

-column 3: direction of auditory sweep. -1 indicates a downward sweep, 0 indicates white noise, 1 indicates an upward sweep

-column 4: tactile sweep depth. Negative numbers indicate downward sweeps

-column 5: subject's response. 1 indicates that they perceived an upward tactile sweep, 2 indicates that they perceived a downward tactile sweep

-column 6: subject's response time (in seconds)
