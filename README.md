Each folder contains raw data for each experiment. Outlier subjects are in a separate "outlier" folder, but are in the same format.

In general: 
-column 1 contains the block number for the trial (5 or 6 blocks per experiment)
-column 2 contains the trial number within the block
-column 3 contains the auditory stimulus information (specified for each experiment)
-column 4 contains the tactile stimulus information (-300 indicating down sweep with a depth of 300 Hz; 0 indicating pure tone of 230 Hz, 300 indicating up sweep with a depth of 300). Ranges from -300 to +300.
-column 5 contains the subject's decision about the stimulus (1 indicates that they perceived an upward sweep, 2 indicates that they perceived a downward sweep)
-column 6 contains the response time
