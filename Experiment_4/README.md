Data from experiment 4, in which subjects judged the direction of a tactile frequency sweep (centered at 230 Hz) in the presence of an auditory intensity sweep distractor.
Auditory distractors were white noise or an intensity sweep at 230 Hz getting louder or softer.

Data format:

-column 1: block number

-column 2: trial number within block

-column 3: direction of auditory sweep. -1 indicates a sweep getting quieter, 0 indicates white noise, 1 indicates a sweep getting louder

-column 4: tactile sweep depth. Negative numbers indicate downward sweeps

-column 5: subject's response. 1 indicates that they perceived an upward tactile sweep, 2 indicates that they perceived a downward tactile sweep

-column 6: subject's response time (in seconds)
